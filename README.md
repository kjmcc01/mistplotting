Mistplotter is a streamlit-hosted web app designed to quickly visualize data using the mistery python package, which retrieves data from the MESA Isochronse and Stellar Models. Mistplotting allows you to customize visualizations for inputs of one or multiple stars across a range of different isochrones. The streamlit app can be run with web_plot.py.


The constraints on inputs for MESA data are as follows:

Stellar Mass (in solar masses): 0.1 - 300__
Metallicity: -4.0 - .5__
Isochrone Age (in Gyr): 1e-4 - 19.953__
