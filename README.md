Mistplotter is a streamlit-hosted web app designed to quickly visualize data using the mistery python package, which retrieves data from the MESA Isochronse and Stellar Models. Mistplotting allows you to customize visualizations for inputs of one or multiple stars across a range of different isochrones.


The constraints on inputs are as follows:

Stellar Mass (in $\(M_\odot)$): 0.1 - 300
Metallicity: -4.0 - .5
Isochrone Age (in Gyr): 1e-4 - 19.953
